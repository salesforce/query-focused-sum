ARTICLE = """A 28-year-old chef who had recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local mall this week. But the victim's brother says he can't think of anyone who would want to hurt him, saying, "Things were finally going well for him." The body found at the Westfield Mall Wednesday morning was identified as 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia, the San Francisco Medical Examiner's Office said. The San Francisco Police Department said the death was ruled a homicide and an investigation is ongoing.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC station KGO in San Francisco that Frank, previously a line cook in Boston, had landed his dream job as line chef at San Francisco's Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
Louis Galicia said Frank initially stayed in hostels, but recently, "Things were finally going well for him."
"He found an apartment, he was dating a girl," Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he could not think of anyone who would want to hurt his younger brother.
"He was a kind spirit with a big heart. His way of connecting with the family was always making us a dish, making us dinner," Louis Galicia said. "He never wanted to be in any kind of altercation. He was the brother that went with the flow."
"With everything else that's going wrong with the world, he was that diamond in the rough that was shining bright every day," he said.
